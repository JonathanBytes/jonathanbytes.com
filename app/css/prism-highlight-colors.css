/* 
  This file contained duplicate color variable definitions that are already 
  defined in globals.css. The color variables are properly defined there
  within the .gruvbox and .catppuccin theme classes for different contexts:
  - Base light mode
  - @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) 
  - [data-theme='dark']
  - [data-theme='light']
  
  Prism syntax highlighting will use those variables via CSS inheritance.
